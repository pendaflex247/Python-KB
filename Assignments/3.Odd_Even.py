#This exercise covers the % modulo operator, and the technique of using 
#modulo-2 arithmetic to determine if a number is even or odd.

#Exercise Description

#Write two functions, isOdd() and isEven(), with a single numeric parameter named number. 
#The isOdd() function returns True if number is odd and False if number is even. 
#The isEven() function returns the True if number is even and False if number is odd. 
#Both functions return False for numbers with fractional parts, such as 3.14 or -4.5. Zero is considered an even number.

#These Python assert statements stop the program if their condition is False. 
##Copy them to the bottom of your solution program. 
#Your solution is correct if the following assert statementsâ€™ conditions are all True:

#assert isOdd(42) == False

#assert isOdd(9999) == True

#assert isOdd(-10) == False

#assert isOdd(-11) == True

#assert isOdd(3.1415) == False

#assert isEven(42) == True

#assert isEven(9999) == False

#assert isEven(-10) == True

#assert isEven(-11) == False

#assert isEven(3.1415) == False
